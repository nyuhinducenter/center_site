  <p>HSC Mandir Lecture Series: The Kathopaniṣad and Spirituality
  Written by Shashank Rao</p>
  <p>I. What are the Upaniṣads?</p>
  <p>The Upaniṣads (उपिनषद) are a collection of Vedānta (वेदांत)
  scriptures, a part of Hindu canon that occurs at the end of Vedic
  scripture. There are about 200+ different Upaniṣads, but only
  about a dozen are considered to be मुख्य (mukhya), or important.
  The subject material typically concerns the metaphysical and less
  concrete aspects of Hindu philosophy. Topics and terms often
  discussed in the Upaniṣads include the Ultimate Reality,
  ब्राह्मन् (Brāhman), आत्मन् (Ātman), and the importance of faith.
  Below is a timeline of well-known Hindu scripture:</p>
  <p>ऋग्वेद (Ṛgveda) - 1500-1100 BCE</p>
  <p>सामवेद (Sāmaveda) - 1500-500 BCE</p>
  <p>यजुवेर्द (Yajurveda) - 1500-500 BCE</p>
  <p>अथवर्वेद (Atharvaveda) - 1500-500 BCE</p>
  <p>उपिनषद (Upaniṣads) - 1200-500 BCE</p>
  <p>महाभारत (Mahabhārata) - 400 BCE - 400 CE</p>
  <p>भगवद्गीत (Bhagavad Gīta) - 400 BCE - 300 CE</p>
  <p>रामायण (Rāmāyaṇa) - 400 BCE - 400 CE</p>

  <p>An important part of Hindu scripture to remember is that
  because it is chronological, the material of any given part of
  scripture exists in relation to the others. The Ṛgveda, for
  example, concerns creation and the cosmology of the Hindu
  conception of the universe, and therefore establishes the
  foundation for discussions found in later texts. That said, the
  material of the Upaniṣads, as you will find in the Kaṭhopaniṣad,
  can seem contradictory of previous established ideas, and may in
  fact be so. Whether new ideas contradict, coexist with, or
  replace previous ideas is dependent on the reader. Intellectual
  freedom and discussion are key tenets of Hindu scripture, and
  this will allow you to understand scripture more thoroughly.</p>
  <p>For your benefit, here are some of the defining principles of
  Hindu cosmology that will be relevant to the discussion of the
  Upaniṣads:</p>
  <p>All living beings have souls that are reincarnated in a cycle
  of death and rebirth, known as saṃsāra. Liberation from this
  cycle is known as मोक्ष (mokṣa), or spiritual liberation. This is
  the ultimate goal of the Hindu: to be free from संसारा (saṃsāra)
  and achieve िनवार्ण (nirvāṇa), and thereby be joined with God.
  This freedom is established by a detachment from earthly desire,
  and fulfilling one’s धमर् (dharma), or personal calling,
  according to a code of ethics and morality. The cycle of saṃsāra
  is also partially dictated by a cosmic principle known as कमर्
  (karma), which is the sum of all deeds, good and bad, accumulated
  over many lifetimes. By balancing the two, such that one’s good
  and bad karma are equal, one can attain liberation.</p>

  <p>निचकेतस (Naciketas) = in search of spiritual knowledge, the
  unperceived, inspiring a search for the spiritual.</p>
  <p>वाजश्रव (Vājaśrava) = famous for donations (real name is
  औद्दलिक - Auddalaki)</p>
  <p>यम(राज) (Yama(rāja)) = the Lord of Death (a form of Lord िशव
  (Śiva), the Destroyer)</p>
  <p>Naciketas, a young Brahmin boy, is concerned for his father’s
  spiritual well-being, since his father gives away barren and used
  cows as donations to the gods and is only concerned with the
  rewards of doing so. Naciketas asks his father three times: “Unto
  whom will you give me?” In anger, Vājaśrava declares that he will
  offer Naciketas to Yama, the Lord of Death.</p>
  <p>Naciketas is horrified and saddened, but resolves to comply
  with his father’s wishes, and travels to meet Yama. When
  Naciketas arrives in the Abode of Death, Yama is absent, and
  Naciketas waits for three days before Yama returns, without food
  or water. It is said that bad luck befalls anyone, even a dēva,
  who neglects to take care of their guests, especially a Brahmin.
  When Yama returns, he is embarrassed and begs forgiveness,
  granting Naciketas three boons as penance.</p>
  <p>Naciketas’ first boon is that he be able to return to the
  world of the living to his father, pacified and free of anger.
  Yama readily grants this. Naciketas then asks Yama to teach him
  the यज्ञ (yajña), or ritual, that allows one to attain
  immortality and reach heaven, where no one fears death, old age,
  or want of food or water. Yama instructs Naciketas in the ritual,
  and names the ritual after him. By performing this ritual three
  times, after uniting with the three: one’s parents and one’s
  teacher, as well as performing the three duties: study (अध्यायन -
  adhyāyana), ritual (यज्ञ - yajña), and charity (दत्त - datta),
  one shall attain the fire of Brāhman. Through understanding these
  three “fires” that comprise the sacred fire, one shall overcome
  sorrow, and attain heaven.</p>
  <p>Yama then asks for Naciketas’ third boon. Naciketas asks the
  Lord of Death: “Teach me what lies beyond death. What becomes of
  oneself when they depart from this world?”</p>
  <p>Yama tells him: “O Naciketas, I beg of you, ask of me another
  boon. This mystery has eluded even the gods, for it is subtle and
  difficult to comprehend. Ask for herds of cattle, for mountains
  of gold, for long lived sons and grandsons, for the entire earth
  and to live as long as you wish. I shall make you a king, the
  enjoyer of all desires, anything but this boon you have asked of
  me! Whatever pleasures of heaven which you desire, I shall grant,
  but do not ask about the Soul after death.”</p>
  <p>But Naciketas replies: “O Yama, these things are but ephemeral
  and wear out one’s senses. Wealth does not confer bliss, and when
  I have seen the undying and divine, how can I wish for anything
  but the knowledge of the hereafter? I cannot ask of you any other
  boon.”</p>
  <p>And so Yama, moved by Naciketas’ faith and sincerity, divulged
  to him the आत्म िवद्या (ātmā- vidyā), or self-knowledge. We
  choose between the good (श्रेयश - śreyaś) and the pleasant
  (प्रेयश - preyaś), which differ in their outcomes. The pleasant
  shall sate worldly wants, but only the wise will choose the good
  over the pleasant. In renouncing worldly desires, such as
  lineage, wealth, and power, Naciketas attained greater knowledge,
  which is a higher purpose. Yama said that those who walk the ways
  of wealth will always remain under his sway, and only by freedom
  from ignorance are they liberated. Only by learning to comprehend
  the Ātman, the Self, do we find freedom from the cycle of death
  and rebirth.</p>
  <p>This knowledge can only be attained through study under an
  able teacher, who is versed in the subtlety of Brāhman
  themselves. It is not attained through argument, but rather
  reason. Under the guidance of the right teacher, reason, the
  highest faculty granted to us, allows us to ascertain the highest
  truths of this world and the next.</p>
  <p>III. Interpreting and Understanding the Story</p>
  <p>Now, one might wonder this: do Naciketas’ second and third
  boons not contradict one another? The second boon gives him
  knowledge of the ritual to attain heaven, which is exactly what
  Naciketas was concerned about with respect to his father’s
  obsession with heavenly rewards.</p>
  <p>Heaven and liberation are not the same thing, as heaven is
  also known as the abode of the dēvas. But even this is not true
  liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. The ritual is
  meant not simply to attain heaven, but rather to focus our
  energies on freeing ourselves from vices such as ignorance,
  irreverence (or faithlessness), and greed. It is but a step in
  the process. Yama goes on to explain that the ritual is the
  “refuge for those who wish to cross the ocean of saṃsāra”
  (I.3.2). It is a method by which we concentrate our energies and
  efforts, but not by which the Self is attained. That is only
  attained through the realization, under the guidance of a
  teacher, that the Self is imperishable, but is “bodiless, seated
  firmly in perishable bodies” (I.2.22). The ritual is a
  psychological focus of faith, but only through study under a
  teacher can the ātmā-vidyā be learned.</p>
  <p>Yet Yama specifically states that the ātmā-vidyā “cannot be
  attained by study of the vedas, nor by intelligence, nor by much
  hearing” (I.2.23). This is to say that one cannot attain
  ātmā-vidyā through simple intelligence, which is differentiated
  from reason. Reason is the faculty by which we understand the
  contents of knowledge divulged unto us, whereas intelligence is
  simply knowing things, not necessarily understanding it.</p>
  <p>But Yama has another caveat: “But he who has not turned away
  from bad conduct, whose senses are not subdued, whose mind is not
  concentrated, whose mind is not pacified, can never obtain this
  Ātman by knowledge.” (I.2.24)</p>
  <p>In this verse, there is a subtle reference to what is known as
  the parable of the chariot (also known as रथ कल्पन (ratha
  kalpana)):</p>
  <p>“Know the Ātman as the Lord of the chariot, the body as the
  chariot; know the intellect as the charioteer and the mind again
  as the reins. They say, the senses are the horses and their
  objects are the roads; the Ātman, the senses and the mind united,
  the wise call the enjoyer. He who has no discrimination and whose
  mind is always uncontrolled, his senses are not controllable like
  vicious horses of a driver. But he who has understanding and
  whose mind is always controlled, his senses are under control
  like good horses of a driver.” (I.3.3-7)</p>
  <p>Through this parable we understand that it is only through the
  control of the senses and application of intelligence (the use of
  reason) that we can comprehend the Self. To “subdue” the senses
  is to gain control over one’s mind and sensory faculties, and use
  those abilities intelligently. We cannot attain this liberation,
  this realization of the Self, without freeing ourselves from
  prejudice, pain, sickness, delusion, anger, or whatever other
  pestilences that plague the world, and infect our senses.</p>
  <p>Now, what is the ultimate answer to Naciketas’ question: What
  happens to the Soul upon death? Yama explains that the Soul is
  imperishable, and an extension of the Universal Ātman, or
  Brāhman. The Soul is reincarnated over and over again, until one
  realizes this truth: that the soul is an extension of the
  Ultimate Reality, which is Brāhman. Upon this realization, it is
  said that we experience bliss or peace, and freedom from worldly
  misery.</p>
  <p>Brāhman, upon division and entering the world, inhabits
  different shapes and forms, establishing a fundamental
  commonality in all beings. We are rivers and tributaries that
  issue from the same source, and ultimately return to the same
  vast ocean that is Brāhman. Yet it also speaks to the differences
  that we cannot ignore, for rivers may flow parallel yet play
  different roles in their various localities, and acquire
  different meanings as a result.</p>
  <p>In the end, the Kaṭhopaniṣad is a story of self-discovery. It
  establishes the need for a spiritual exploration of both the
  world and the self, that simply ritual and factual knowledge of
  the universe is not enough to be free of suffering. Whether
  spirituality concerns religion or not is a different matter.
  Spiritual nourishment is essential to the soul, and simply going
  through the motions of life are insufficient, and for some,
  entirely unnecessary. Through devotion to art, God, or one’s
  craft, we can find purpose and fulfillment of our spirit.</p>
  <p>Here are some questions to ponder:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What does “spirituality” mean to you?</li>
    <li>What is the importance of yajña in Hinduism or in any
    religion?</li>
    <li>How is “reaching heaven” and “attaining immortality”
    different from mokṣa (spiritual liberation)?</li>
    <li>Does death’s portrayal in this story surprise you? In what
    ways?</li>
    <li>What is the significance of the use of “fire” as a concept?
    Is it literal, or figurative?</li>
    <li>What’s an example of the good versus the pleasant?</li>
    <li>Is self-knowledge important to you?</li>
