    <H1>Links</H1>Here are some links to other sites that we have
    found informative. A link here is not necessarily an

    Descriptive blurbs are mostly copied from the sites, with some

    <P>Remember that Hinduism is a conglomeration of a wide variety
    of traditions, lineages, sects, etc. It has no central
    authority, and is not monolithic. Assertions made by a
    particular sect or lineage may not apply universally.</P>
    <H2><A href="http://swamij.com/">Abhyasa Ashram</A></H2>" The
    goal of our sadhana or practices is the highest Joy that comes
    from the Realization in direct experience of the center of
    consciousness, the Self, the Atman or Purusha, which is one and
    the same with the Absolute Reality. This Self-Realization comes
    through the three streams of: 1) traditional Yoga meditation of
    the Yoga Sutras, 2) the contemplative insight of Advaita
    Vedanta, and 3) the intense devotion of Samaya Sri Vidya
    Tantra, the three of which complement one another like fingers
    on a hand. - Yoga - The goal of Yoga is Yoga." Lots of
    information here.

    integral manner with regard to its Vedic origins. Aside from
    the courses, there are lots of resources on the site.

    interested students of Kriya Yoga an opportunity to download my
    book: "Kriya Yoga: synthesis of a personal experience." By
    releasing this book freely, I have no intention to create a new
