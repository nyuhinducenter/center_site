    <H2><A href="https://vedanet.com/">American Institute of Vedic
    Studies</A></H2>American Institute of Vedic Studies’ online
    courses provide you with a distinct opportunity to learn from
    Dr. David Frawley (Pandit Vamadeva Shastri) and begin an
    enduring journey with the timeless wisdom of the Vedas. It
    focuses on Ayurveda, Yoga-Vedanta, Vedic astrology and their
    interconnections. It correlates Veda and Tantra along with the
    background system of Hinduism or ‘Sanatana Dharma’. It
    emphasizes bringing together the greater Yoga tradition in an
    integral manner with regard to its Vedic origins. Aside from
    the courses, there are lots of resources on the site.

    Hindu Calendar</A></H2>The drikPanchang.com site generates
    panchang, festival and vrat dates for more than 20,000 cities.
    All festivals and vrats are listed based on location. All
    calculations are based on Drik Ganita i.e. on precise
    calculations of planetary positions. Aside from calendar info
    there are sections on Jyotish, Music, Art, Etc. This is a
    fabulous resource.

    interested students of Kriya Yoga an opportunity to download my
    book: "Kriya Yoga: synthesis of a personal experience." By
    releasing this book freely, I have no intention to create a new
    school of Kriya Yoga. It will remain forever what it is now:
    just a sharing of a personal experience. I hope it will be
    received favorably by those for whom it was conceived and
    intended.

    sub-continent. Although in recent years, in the Western world,
    it has become almost exclusively associated with sex, in
    reality this is one aspect of what is a way of life.
