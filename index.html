  <P>Join Us</P>

  <P>Come join the Hindu Community at the first Hindu Center at New
  York University.</P>

  <P>Community members are encouraged to come too. You don't have
  to be a student, or affiliated with NYU to attend.</P>

  <P>Community involvement is important in order to support the
  students, and have continuity in the Center since students will
  come and go.</P>

  <P>A short puja will be held every Saturday afternoon from 3-5
  PM. Major holidays will be observed too.</P>

  <P>Get involved so we can all benefit.</P>

  <P>This can be the beginning of a permanent Hindu Center at NYU
  for all to use.</P>

  <P>While there, sign our mailing list, and if you like, we will
  keep you informed of coming events at the center.</P>

  <P>Note: Please bring photo ID</P>

  <P>You will have to log in at the front desk. Please bring some
  photo ID, and tell the guards you're here for the Hindu
  Center.</P>
