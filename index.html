  <P>Come join the Hindu Community at the first Hindu Center at New
  York University.</P>


  <P>Community members are encouraged to come too. You don't have
  to be a student, or affiliated with NYU to attend. All are
  welcome.</P>


  <P>Community involvement is important in order to support the
  students, and have continuity in the Center since students will
  come and go.</P>


  <P>A short puja will be held every Saturday afternoon from 3-5
  PM. Major holidays will be observed too.</P>


  <P>Get involved so we can all benefit. This can be the beginning
  of a permanent Hindu Center at NYU for all to use. While there,
  sign our mailing list, and if you like, we will keep you informed
  of coming events at the center.</P>
