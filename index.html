<a id="join-us" class="anchor" href="#join-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Join Us!</h3>

<p>Come join the Hindu Community at the first Hindu Center at New York
University.</p>

<p>Community members are encouraged to come too. You don't have to be a
student, or affiliated with NYU to attend.</p>

<p>Community involvement is important in order to support the students, and have continuity in the Center since students will come and go.</p>

<p>A short puja will be held every Saturday afternoon from 3-5 PM. Major holidays will be observed too.</p>

<p>Get involved so we can all benefit.
This can be the beginning of a permanent Hindu Center at NYU for all to use.
While there, sign our mailing list, and if you like, we will keep you informed of coming events at the center.</p>
