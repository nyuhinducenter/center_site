<div>NOTE: The Center will be closed until early February, 2017, dates TBD. We are working out our schedule and plan to do many exciting things, so stay tuned for details! There will be pujas and other events coming your way. See you then!

<h2>
<a id="join-us" class="anchor" href="#join-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Join Us!</h2>

<p>Come join the Hindu Community at the first Hindu Center at New York
University.</p>

<p>Community members are encouraged to come too. You don't have to be a
student, or affiliated with NYU to attend. All are welcome.</p>

<p>Community involvement is important in order to support the students, and have continuity in the Center since students will come and go.</p>

<p>A short puja will be held every Saturday afternoon from 3-5 PM. Major holidays will be observed too.</p>

<p>Get involved so we can all benefit.
This can be the beginning of a permanent Hindu Center at NYU for all to use.
While there, sign our mailing list, and if you like, we will keep you informed of coming events at the center.</p>
