    <H2>Join Us!</H2>
    <P>Come join the Hindu Community at the first Hindu Center at
    New York University.</P>
    <P>Community members are encouraged to come too. You don't have
    to be a student, or affiliated with NYU to attend. All are
    welcome.</P>
    <P>Community involvement is important in order to support the
    students, and have continuity in the Center since students will
    come and go.</P>
    <P>A short puja will be held Saturday afternoons from 3-5 PM as
    noted. Major holidays will be observed too.</P>
    <P>Get involved so we can all benefit. This can be the
    beginning of a permanent Hindu Center at NYU for all to use.
    While there, sign our mailing list, and if you like, we will
    keep you informed of coming events at the center.</P>
    <H2>Note: Please bring photo ID</H2>
    <P>You will have to log in at the front desk. Please bring
    photo ID, and tell the guards you're here for the Hindu
    Center.</P>
