    <H1>About Us</H1>The Hindu Center at NYU is being organized by
    a group of students working under the auspices of the Hindu
    Student Council.
    <P>There are also several non-students involved, as the Hindu
    Center is a resource for the students at NYU, and the wider
    Hindu community.</P>
    <P>Things are still in the initial stages of formation. We will
    provide contact info and other details soon. For now, contact
    us by showing up at the Center on Saturdays between 3-5pm.</P>
